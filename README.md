# Scalabale blockchain system

For many years, numerous cryptocurrencies have been supported by the 
innovative technology known as blockchain. This decentralized system, 
despite having many unique characteristics, falls behind centralized 
currency systems in terms of scalability and cannot be adopted by other 
platforms. Increasing throughput and reducing the dependence on huge storage 
are the goals of this project. The storing obligations are avoided, and 
throughput is increased by using the distributed storage system named IPFS. 
By inserting references to the main block into the ledger in place of the 
original block, the dual blockchain approach serves the fundamental 
characteristics of the blockchain.
